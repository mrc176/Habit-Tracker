Swing is a feature our group has varying amounts of familiarity with but have all used at one point or another.
However, further knowledge and understanding of how to properly apply Swing in a larger scope is required to
utilize it in the scope of our current project.

The tools, guides, and etc. utilized for JavaSwing research were as follows:

The use of Swing as UI with Java creates some limitations. To explore the full potential of our program, some time
was spent researching the possibility and feasibility of implementing the UI of our project with JavaFX, through the
use of tutorials and guides to build an understanding and familiarity the tool. Ultimately, given that the whole of
the team (myself included) already have past experience with Swing and are operating with severe time constraints to
which learning JavaFX from scratch for project use would be limiting, we have opted to fully utilize Java Swing for
our tasks going forward.

The tools, guides, and etc. utilized for JavaFX research were as follows:
